# The Unscramble App

**The Unscramble** is a single-player word scrambler game where the goal is to unscramble the letters of a word.

This project was built as part of the [Android Basics with Compose](https://developer.android.com/courses/android-basics-compose/course) course and focuses on modern Android development practices using **Jetpack Compose**, **ViewModel**, **StateFlow**, and **UDF (User Defined Functions)** patterns.

## Key Learnings

- **Modern Architecture**: Built with Jetpack Compose, ViewModel, and StateFlow for clean and maintainable code.
- **Jetpack Compose**: Used for building a fully declarative and responsive UI.
- **ViewModel & StateFlow**: Implemented for managing game data, ensuring proper separation of concerns and better state management.
- **App Lifecycle Management**: Saved and restored data across device rotations using ViewModel and StateFlow.
